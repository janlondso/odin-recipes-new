    <p>Slow-cooked beef chuck roast seasoned with a smoky chipotle chili spice mix.
        Then braised with fresh orange juice until caramelized and falling apart.
        Shred the meat, then stuff it into warm taco shells with a quick red salsa verde sauce,
        jalapeño yogurt, and crumbled cotija cheese. These tacos are saucy, spicy, cheesy, and so yummy!
        You’ll love this slow cooker recipe any time of year on a busy day.</p>
    <p>Taco Tuesday is more of a thing, but this week we’ve got Wednesday night tacos,
        and we are here for it. I’ve been so excited to share this easy recipe.
        These are currently some of our most favorite tacos!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The seasoning
            My go-to taco seasoning blend is chipotle chili powder, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, garlic powder, Mexican oregano, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Slow-cook the meat
            You can braise the meat in the oven or use the crock pot. Both methods are almost identical and equally delicious.
            Arrange lots of sliced onions in the bottom of the slow cooker. Add orange juice and a small bit of honey, then water. Slow braise the meat for 2-3 hours in the oven or 5 hours in the crockpot. As the meat is slowly cooking, the braising liquid turns into a yummy red sauce. Save this sauce, and we’ll make a dipping sauce with it!
        </li>
        <li>Shred the meat
            When the roast is falling apart, remove it from the pot and shred the meat.
        </li>
        <li>The sauce
            Now take the red sauce in the pot and mix it with salsa verde. This is your dipping/drizzling sauce for the tacos. It’s spicy and smoky. Make sure to season with salt.
            For this jalapeño lime yogurt, simply add everything to a bowl – the yogurt, garlic, pickled jalapeños, lime, and salt. Then mix until creamy. The recipe is in the ingredient notes!
        </li>
        <li>Assemble
            Originally, I was going to make these crispy tacos, which you can still totally do. But I didn’t have the right tortillas. So I used some soft shells tortillas from Caramelo Tortillas that I had on hand. We ended up loving them. Using good tortillas is the key to great soft-shell tacos, and theirs are the best. I like the pork and duck fat options.
            Stuff the meat into the charred tortillas. Then take the red verde sauce and spoon it over the meat. Add all of your favorite taco toppings–avocado, cilantro, and lots of sharp cheddar cheese and/or cojita cheese.
