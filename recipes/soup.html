    <p>This simple, creamy homestyle chicken noodle soup is the perfect comfort food. It’s great for nights when you’re craving something warm and cozy. It’s a mix of shredded chicken and vegetables simmered with warming seasonings, a splash of cream, and classic egg noodles. Finish each bowl off with an extra sprinkle of cheese and serve with crusty bread. It’s hearty, full of herbs and veggies, and so delicious.</p>

    Ingredients 

salted butter
yellow onions,
garlic
carrots
celery
all-purpose flour
fresh or dry thyme
fresh or dry sage
a dry bay leaf
broth
boneless chicken breast or thighs
egg noodles
whole milk or cream
parmesan cheese
fresh parsley, sage, or thyme


Step 1: make the soup base

Cook the butter with the onions, garlic, carrots, and celery. Get the vegetables soft, then add the flour. We’re using flour to help create a creamy soup!

Add the thyme and sage. I use fresh herbs when I have them, but I only had dry thyme and then some fresh sage. If you only have dry herbs, that’s ok, use those!

Step 2: add the broth and simmer the chicken

Now add the broth. I like to use chicken bone broth.

Mix in the chicken. I use chicken breasts and thighs, but don’t tell my mom that! She hates thighs. Allow the chicken to simmer in the broth until it’s fully cooked throughout, which will take about 15 to 20 minutes.

If you have a parmesan rind on hand, adding it in with the chicken really does add nice flavor. It complements this homemade chicken noodle soup recipe so deliciously.

Step 3: shred the chicken and cook the noodles

Shred the chicken, I usually leave the chicken in the broth.

Then, add the noodles to the boiling broth and allow them to cook, usually 2 to 3 minutes. You’ll know the noodles are ready when they float to the top.

I love to use thick, homestyle egg noodles. Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s usually have nice options, or you can make your own!

It’s an extra step, but if you want to make your own, here is how I make them: Mix 2 cups flour with 2 teaspoons salt, 3 egg yolks, 1 whole egg, and then 1/4 cup hot water. Simply mix with a spatula, adding more water until you have a dough ball. Roll the dough out like a pie crust, then cut into strips, then squares/rectangles. Boil them just as directed!

Step 4: mix in the cream and finish the soup

When ready, mix in a cup of whole milk or cream. Then add some parmesan and finish the soup with fresh parsley or whatever herb you have. I used sage!

Then season with salt and pepper to make sure it’s just perfect!

Step 5: serve

I recommend serving this soup with a side of crusty bread. It’s the best accompaniment to a bowl of chicken noodle soup.

One last tip: If you’re planning to enjoy this soup leftover, be sure to remove the noodles before refrigerating. Removing the noodles from the broth prevents them from soaking up all the broth. Then, just add them back in before serving.
