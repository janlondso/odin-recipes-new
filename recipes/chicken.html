 <h1>30 Minute Honey Garlic Chicken</h1>
 <p>
    30 Minute Honey Garlic Chicken, a new go-to sheet pan meal. Easy, homemade crispy chicken tossed in a spicy-sweet honey garlic sauce. Serve this dish with asparagus, broccoli, or a combination of the two, cooked up right alongside the chicken. It’s the easiest sheet pan dinner. Add a side of rice for a main, or serve it on its own as an appetizer. This fun take-out-style dinner is great any night of the week!

    Some of my favorite types of dinners to create and share with my family are fun takeout-inspired dinners made at home. Well, tacos are probably my favorite, but takeout at home is a close second. My younger sister, Asher, adores any dish with a hit of soy sauce (I use tamari) and served over rice. Just like my mom, Asher adores rice.

I often make dishes like today’s recipe for them, but I love sharing new sauces and flavors! I always have fun creating these recipes.

I shared my recipe for chili ginger orange chicken just after the holidays. Since then, I’ve made it multiple times. The chili orange sauce is so delicious!

    I felt like it was time to shake things up, so instead of the classic orange sauce, today I’m sharing a honey garlic sauce made with lemon! This sauce is so simple, but wow, the flavors really are delicious.

Honey, garlic, and lemon, all mixed with salty tamari – such an addicting sauce!

Ingredients

Boneless Skinless Chicken breasts or thighs, cut into cubes 
Garlic powder 
Black pepper and Chile flakes 
Flour or gluten free flour 
Extra virgin olive oil 
Broccoli florets or chopped asparagus 
Sesame seeds 

Honey Garlic Sauce

Tamari or soy sauce 
Lemon juice 
Honey 
Garlic 
Chili paste 
Chopped green onion 
Toasted sesame oil 

Step 1: start with the chicken

I like to use cubed raw chicken—breasts or thighs, or a mix of the two. Toss the cubed chicken with garlic powder, black pepper, and chile flakes. I love to use Korean chile flakes. You can find them online, at Whole Foods, and in most major grocery stores in the Asian aisle.

Now add some flour. The flour allows the chicken to get crispy in the oven. It’s a small amount, so just a very light coating. It’s not a breaded chicken but it has just enough of a coating to ensure the sauce can stick nicely to the chicken.

Bake the chicken with a side of asparagus or broccoli. Depending on the size of your chicken pieces, this should take about 10 to 15 minutes to cook.

Step 2: the honey garlic sauce

This really is the heart of the recipe. The sauce brings all the flavor.

Mix the tamari (or soy sauce), with lemon juice and honey. The honey not only adds flavor but creates a sticky sauce that will adhere nicely to the chicken.

Then, fresh garlic, chili paste, green onions, and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. If you don’t have toasted sesame, you can easily just omit it from the sauce. I do love the flavor, but it is not a must.

Like most of my Asian-inspired dishes, I love to use chili paste. More often than not I use gochujang, a Korean chili paste. This really provides that extra flavor. The Mother in Law’s brand is my favorite, I get the original flavor from Whole Foods or order on Amazon.Step 2: the honey garlic sauce

Step 3: toss the chicken and the sauce

Pour the sauce over the baked crispy chicken and cook the chicken in the sauce over medium-high heat. Stir with a wooden spoon. The coating soaks up all the sauce – yum!

Step 4: serve with rice

You can easily serve this as is, but we love this chicken best served over rice and topped with lots of toasted sesame seeds.
